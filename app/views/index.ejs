                                    My language game is a unique method of teaching foreign language in a fun and engaging way. It immerses students in a game world where they follow the storyline of becoming the hero as they save a village fallen under siege of an Ancient Dragon and his minions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While immersed in the storyline, the student uses the underlying language instruction system to solve game challenges which allows them to progress to new quests and new levels. Each level has several quests, which each contain several characters with challenges to solve.

                                    With months of hard work, and the help of a close friends and contributors, I was able to host successful beta tests at Connecticut high schools.

                                    I traveled with a few teammates to work with 20+ students and teachers as they tried out my product. With built-in metrics collection,
                                    a <a href="http://clg-dashboard.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/#/" target="_blank" class="link">feedback dashboard for teachers</a>, and well-tested game design, the students were able to play through all 4 quests of the game.
                                    The beta lasted about two hours.
                                </p>

                                    This was an amazing experience that taught me about iterative design, validation, and usability testing.

                                    Students found themselves in situations I had never dreamed of which was humbling to say the least. Fortunately,
                                    a post-game survey showed 100% interest in replay and positive learning trends. The average sweetspot of words learned per day is 15,
                                    yet many of my students were able to recall 15 vocab words within 2 hours.
